*2.2 More Data Basics
* 13 October 2020 -
* Extra Thing on AP String: Asks user for favorite food and adds it with color and age
* Extra Thing on More Programs - Data Basics: spamMail divided by two and also multipled by 3
* Extra Thing on Cin and setPrecesion - tells employee if there is no change or if customer did not pay enough money
* Extra thing on divison and modulus - After user enter a 3 digit number and it prints they will be asked if they want to do the same with a 4 digit number
